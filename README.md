# Node/Backend Tryouts

Some of all the tools/technologies related to backend that I learned and tried doing hands-on by thinking of some usecase and building a little project on it.

The technologies and tools which are used are 

1. GraphQL with Apollo
2. Redis
3. Class based Javascript (OOP)
4. Cookie with backend
5. Legacy GraphQL
6. JsDoc
7. Mongoose Library and its features
8. QR code with custom logo
9. Queues
